		<h1>About total managment?</h1>
		<p>Customer-focused: The customer ultimately determines the level of quality. No matter what an organization does to foster quality improvement—training employees, integrating quality into the design process, or upgrading computers or software—the customer determines whether the efforts were worthwhile.</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			Total employee involvement: All employees participate in working toward common goals. Total employee commitment can only be obtained after fear has been driven from the workplace, when empowerment has occurred, and when management has provided the proper environment.
			<b>"High-performance"</b>
			work systems integrate continuous improvement efforts with normal business operations. Self-managed work teams are one form of empowerment.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>Process-centered: A fundamental part of TQM is a focus on process thinking. A process is a series of steps that take inputs from suppliers (internal or external) and transforms them into outputs that are delivered to customers (internal or external).</p>
		<br>
		<p>The steps required to carry out the process are defined, and performance measures are continuously monitored in order to detect unexpected variation.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Integrated system: Although an organization may consist of many different functional specialties often organized into vertically structured departments, it is the horizontal processes interconnecting these functions that are the focus of TQM. </p>
